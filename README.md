# Canister-Idea-Decentralized-Weather-Oracle
Canister Idea - Decentralized Weather Oracle for ICP network

Description:
The Decentralized Weather Oracle is a canister on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) platform that provides real-time weather data using decentralized sources. It collects weather information from multiple decentralized weather stations distributed around the world and aggregates it to provide accurate and reliable weather forecasts.

Features:
Real-time Weather Data: Provides up-to-date weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.
Decentralized Data Sources: Collects weather data from decentralized weather stations powered by IoT devices and blockchain technology.
Weather Forecasting: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict future weather conditions based on historical data and current trends.
API Integration: Offers an API for developers to access weather data and integrate it into their decentralized applications (dapps) and smart contracts.
Immutable Data: Stores weather data on the ICP blockchain, ensuring transparency, security, and tamper resistance.
